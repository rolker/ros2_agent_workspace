## Naming Conventions

### Official Names

| Context | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| First reference | Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping / Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) |
| Subsequent references | CCOM/JHC, or "the Center" |
| Component names | CCOM (mapping focus), JHC (hydrographic focus) |
| Parent institution | University of New Hampshire (UNH) |
| School | School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering |
| College | College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS) |

### Naming Rules

- Always use the full name on first reference in any document, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
- Use "the Center" (capitalized) as shorthand in running text after the first reference.
- The slash in "CCOM/JHC" has spaces around it in the full name but not in the abbreviation.
- Describe as "a national center of expertise in ocean mapping and hydrographic sciences."
- Reference the NOAA partnership: "a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and NOAA."

## Editorial Standards

### Style Guide

CCOM/JHC follows **AP Stylebook** with UNH-specific exceptions:

| Rule | Standard |
|------|----------|
| Serial/Oxford comma | Permitted for clarity |
| Em dashes | With spaces: ` -- ` (not `---` or `—`) |
| Numbers | Spell out one through nine; numerals for 10+ |
| Times | Lowercase with periods: 3:30 p.m. |
| Months with dates | Abbreviate 6+ letter months: Sept. 8, but July 12 |
| Phone numbers | (603) 862-XXXX format |
| Websites | Omit "www" prefix; lowercase "website," "web," "internet" |
| Degrees | Lowercase generic: bachelor's, master's, doctorate |
| "Dr." title | Only for licensed medical professionals, not PhDs |
| Singular "they" | Accepted |

### Tone of Voice

- **Professional and academic** — formal without being stiff
- **Research-forward** — lead with capabilities and achievements, not promotional language
- **Factual and accomplishment-oriented** — demonstrate expertise through what has been done
- **Accessible** — technical when describing research, but provide context for non-specialists
- **Third person** — use "the Center" or "CCOM/JHC," not "we" in formal documentation
- **Collaborative** — emphasize partnerships with NOAA, agencies, universities, and industry
- **Educational** — "train the next generation" is a recurring theme

### Writing Patterns

- Emphasize the dual mission: developing ocean mapping tools **and** training the next generation of hydrographers.
- Position within institutional hierarchy when relevant: "a key component of UNH's School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering."
- Research areas in navigation/headings may be capitalized (Autonomous Systems, Data Visualization); use lowercase in running text.
- Define technical terms on first use for general audiences (e.g., "hydrography — the science of measuring and describing the physical features of bodies of water").

## Mission Statement

Use when a mission reference is needed:

> To develop tools to advance ocean mapping and hydrography, and to train the
> next generation of hydrographers and ocean mappers.

4. **Tone check**: Ensure content is professional, third-person, research-forward, and accessible.
5. **Style compliance**: Apply AP Stylebook rules with UNH exceptions listed above.
6. **Dual mission**: When describing the Center's purpose, include both the tools/research and education/training aspects.
