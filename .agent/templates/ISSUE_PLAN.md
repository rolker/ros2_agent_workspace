# Work Plan Template

Reference for agents writing implementation plans. Use this structure as a guide
when preparing a plan for user approval. Not all sections are required — include
only what is relevant to the task.

Claude Code agents do not need to follow this template literally; plan mode
produces well-structured plans naturally. This is primarily useful for agent
frameworks without a built-in planning step.

## Problem Analysis

Describe what is broken, missing, or needs improvement. Include relevant context
from the issue and any investigation findings.

## Proposed Approach

Outline the solution strategy. If there are alternative approaches, mention them
and explain why this one was chosen.

## Implementation Tasks

Break the work into concrete steps, grouped by phase if appropriate.

### Phase 1: ...
- Task 1
- Task 2

### Phase 2: ...
- Task 1
- Task 2

## Design Decisions

Document key choices and their rationale, especially where reasonable alternatives
exist.

## Open Questions

List any uncertainties and how you plan to resolve them. These should ideally be
resolved with the user before starting implementation.

## Success Criteria

Define what "done" looks like — how will you verify the implementation is correct?
